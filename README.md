# Cyber-Security-
# Ethical Hacking Repository
# After certifying in CISSP i realized that i was not fully qualified in the nuts and bolts of cyber security. having taken a long hard look at myself and the skill s i possess i realized tht it is time tht i set myself up for a better career by engaging in some deep level stuff to hone my skill. one of the subjects i will run with for a while will be ethical Hacking which should allow me the leeway to enter the cyber security profession as a qualified personal and person. such is the world of cyber security i sahll be in it for life.
